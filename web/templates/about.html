            <h1>Help &amp; Support</h1>

            <h2>Browser Support</h2>

            <p>
            BareRTC should work on most modern web browsers. It has been tested in
            Firefox and Chromium on desktop Linux and on Android. It utilizes open
            web standards including
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank">WebSockets</a>
            (for most of the text chat features) and <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank">WebRTC</a>
            (for webcam and microphone sharing).
            </p>

            <h2>Webcam Streaming</h2>

            <p>
            The WebRTC technology used by this chat room allows for direct, <strong>peer to peer</strong>
            connections between you and the other chat members to stream video and audio directly to one
            another, without needing a server in the middle to relay all that data. In many cases, WebRTC
            should "just work" but you may run into trouble broadcasting if your local network is heavily
            firewalled (for example on a corporate or school network).
            </p>

            <p>
            In many WebRTC video apps (such as Zoom, Jitsi, Google Hangouts, etc.), when one or both parties
            are on such difficult networks, a server in the middle is used to transfer the video data between
            them. BareRTC does not have any such server, as the bandwidth costs to carry your video could get
            expensive! If your video sharing is not working, it's unfortunate but you should still be able to
            have text chat conversations as normal.
            </p>

            <h2>Styling Your Messages</h2>

            <p>
            BareRTC supports Markdown syntax for your chat messages. You can make text <strong>bold</strong>
            by putting asterisks around part of it, <strong>**like this**</strong> or make text italic with
            <em>*single asterisks*</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Hyperlinks you paste that begin with https:// will be clickable as-is, or you can create a custom
            label for it by typing e.g. <code>[click my link](https://www.wikipedia.org/)</code>.
